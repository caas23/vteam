The _Solo Scoot_ project includes admin and user web clients, a user app, a REST API, database connection via MongoDb, as well as the ability to simulate the entire system using Docker Compose.

For more information about each individual client, navigate to its folder under `./services`. The simulation is accessed via `./simulation` where all the information to get started and run the system is gathered.
