# Vteam user web

_The user's web application for the vteam project._

### About

Via the web application, the user can view and manage their _Solo Scoot_ account, along with their trips and payments. To access the application, authentication via Github OAuth is required.

### Running

To run as part of the entire project, see [simulation](https://github.com/caas23/vteam/tree/main/simulation).

To run as a standalone application, run `npx vite` and then start the app on `localhost:5174/`*.

_* Note that the application runs against the backend set up in [rest-api](https://github.com/caas23/vteam/tree/main/services/rest-api)._
